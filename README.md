# MedNgage: A Dataset for Studying Engagement in Patient-Nurse Conversations 

The MedNgage dataset contains de-identified patient-nurse conversations from asynchronized message boards on cancer symptom management. The dataset includes 2.1K turns between 4 nurse interventionists and 68 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

To ensure HIPAA-compliance and protect patient privacy, we used the NLM Scrubber offered by NIH to produce the de-identified health information for scientific use. Two independent annotators evaluated the dataset to ensure that patients cannot be traced.

To access the dataset, interested investigators must comply with NIH data sharing requirements, including obtaining an Ethical Review from their institution and submitting a formal request for the data by filling out the Data Request Application Form. The form can be found in the "Form/Data Request Application Form" directory.

Please send the completed Ethical Review and Data Request Application to Dr. Heidi Donovan (<donovanh@pitt.edu>) to request access to the dataset.
